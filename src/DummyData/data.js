    question: "What is the powerhouse of the cell?",
    answer:
      "The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondrion, an organelle that plays a crucial role in energy production through the process of cellular respiration. Mitochondria convert the chemical energy stored in glucose and other nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy carrier in cells. They are also involved in various metabolic processes, including the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis (programmed cell death). The number of mitochondria in a cell can vary significantly, reflecting the energy demands of different cell types, such as muscle cells, which contain a high density of these organelles.",
